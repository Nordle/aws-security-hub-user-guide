# Filtering and grouping findings \(console\)<a name="findings-filtering-grouping"></a>

When you first display a list of findings, the list is always filtered based on the record state and workflow status\. This is in addition to the filters for an insight, integration, or control\.

The record state indicates whether the finding is active or archived\. A finding can be archived by the finding provider\. AWS Security Hub also automatically archives findings for controls if the associated resource is deleted\. By default, a finding list only shows active findings\.

The workflow status indicates the status of the investigation into the finding\. The workflow status can only be updated by the Security Hub customer or a system that is operating on the customer's behalf\. By default, a finding list only shows findings with a workflow status of `NEW` or `NOTIFIED`\. The default finding list for a control also includes `RESOLVED` findings\.

When you display a list of findings for a control, you can only filter based on text in the finding list\. You cannot add or remove filters, or group the findings\.

For other lists of findings, you can change the filters and group the findings\.

## Adding filters<a name="finding-list-filters"></a>

To change the scope of the list, you can add filters to it\.

When filtering the finding list, Security Hub applies AND logic to the set of filters\. In other words, a finding only matches if it matches all of the provided filters\. For example, if the filters are "Product name is GuardDuty" and "Resource type is `AwsS3Bucket`," then matching findings must match both of these criteria\.

However, Security Hub applies OR logic to filters that use the same attribute but different values\. For example, assume that the filters are "Product name is GuardDuty" and "Product name is Amazon Inspector\." In that case, a finding matches if it was generated by either GuardDuty or Amazon Inspector\.

**To add a filter to the finding list**

1. Choose the search box\.

1. In the menu, under **Filters**, choose a filter\.

1. Choose the filter match type\.

   For a string filter, you can choose whether the value matches \(**EQUALS**\) or starts with \(**PREFIX**\) the filter value\.

   For a numeric filter, you can choose whether to provide a single number \(**Simple**\) or a range of numbers \(**Range**\)\.

   For a datetime field, you can choose whether to provide a length of time from the current date time \(**Rolling window**\) or a date range \(**Fixed range**\)\.

1. Specify the filter value\.

   Note that for string fields, the filter value is case sensitive\.

   For example, for findings from Security Hub, **Product name** isSecurity Hub\. If you use the **EQUALS** operator to see findings from Security Hub, you must enter **Security Hub** as the filter value\. If you enter **security hub**, no findings are displayed\.

   Similarly, if you use the **PREFIX** operator, and enter **Sec**, Security Hub findings are displayed\. If you enter **sec**, no Security Hub findings are displayed\.

1. Choose **Apply**\.

## Grouping findings<a name="finding-list-grouping"></a>

In addition to changing the filters, you can group the findings based on the values of a selected attribute\.

When you group the findings, the list of findings is replaced with a list of values for the selected attribute in the matching findings\. For each value, the list displays the number of findings that match the other filter criteria\.

For example, if you group the findings by AWS account ID, you see a list of account identifiers, with the number of matching findings for each account\.

When you choose an attribute value, the list of matching findings for that value is displayed\.

**To group the findings in a findings list**

1. Choose the search box\.

1. In the menu, under **Grouping**, choose **Group by**\.

1. In the list, choose the field to use for the grouping\.

1. Choose **Apply**\.

## Changing a filter value or grouping attribute<a name="finding-list-change-filter-value"></a>

For an existing filter, you can change the filter value\. You can also change the grouping attribute\.

For example, you can change the **Record state** filter to look for `ARCHIVED` findings instead of `ACTIVE` findings\.

**To edit a filter or grouping attribute**

1. Choose the filter or grouping attribute\.

1. For the grouping field, choose the new attribute, then choose **Apply**\.

1. For a filter, choose the new value, and then choose **Apply**\.

## Deleting a filter or grouping attribute<a name="finding-list-delete-filter"></a>

To delete a filter or grouping attribute, choose the **x** icon\.

The list is updated automatically to reflect the change\. When you remove the grouping attribute, the list changes from the list of field values back to a list of findings\.
