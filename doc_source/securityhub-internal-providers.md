# AWS Product Integrations<a name="securityhub-internal-providers"></a>

Security Hub consolidates security findings generated by the following AWS services:
+ [IAM Access Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html)
+ [Amazon GuardDuty](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/what-is-guardduty.html)
+ [Amazon Inspector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_introduction.html)
+ [Amazon Macie](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/userguide/what-is-macie.html)

To integrate these services with Security Hub, you just need to enable them in your account on the console for each service\. A resource policy that allows Security Hub to get findings from these services is automatically created and applied\. You do not need to configure any settings to start getting findings from them\. After you enable them, Security Hub immediately starts collecting new findings in that account from these services\.

**Important**  
Only new findings generated from these services after you enable Security Hub are sent to Security Hub\. No findings that were generated before you enabled Security Hub are sent to Security Hub\.

If you don't have a supported AWS product enabled, or the integration is not enabled in Security Hub, no findings are sent to Security Hub\. You can verify whether a product integration is enabled on the **Integrations** page of the Security Hub console\.

For IAM Access Analyzer, all findings are sent to Security Hub\. IAM Access Analyzer uses logic\-based reasoning to analyze resource\-based policies applied to supported resources in your account\. IAM Access Analyzer generates a finding when it detects a policy statement that allows an external principal access to a resource in your account\.

With GuardDuty, Security Hub imports GuardDuty findings of all of the supported finding types\. New findings from GuardDuty are sent to Security Hub within 5 minutes\. Updates to findings are sent based on the **Updated findings** setting for CloudWatch Events in GuardDuty settings\. When you generate GuardDuty sample findings using the GuardDuty **Setting** page, Security Hub ingests the sample findings and omits the prefix '\[Sample\]' in the finding type\. For example, the sample finding type in GuardDuty "\[SAMPLE\] Recon:IAMUser/ResourcePermissions” is displayed as "Recon:IAMUser/ResourcePermissions” in Security Hub\. For more information about GuardDuty findings, see [Amazon GuardDuty Findings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_findings.html)\.

With Amazon Inspector, Security Hub imports Amazon Inspector findings that are generated through assessment runs based on all supported rules packages\. For more information about Amazon Inspector rules packages and rules, see [Amazon Inspector Rules Packages and Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_rule-packages.html)\.

With Macie, a finding \(currently known as an alert\) can be one of the following indices: **CloudTrail data**, **S3 bucket properties**, and **S3 objects**\. For more information, see [Locating and Analyzing Macie Alerts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/userguide/macie-alerts.html#macie-alert-working-locate)\. Security Hub imports Macie basic and custom alerts \(findings\) only from the **S3 bucket properties** and **S3 objects** indices\. Macie does not send data classifications\. Security Hub does *not* import Macie findings from the **CloudTrail data** index\.
