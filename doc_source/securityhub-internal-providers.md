# AWS Product Integrations<a name="securityhub-internal-providers"></a>

Security Hub consolidates security findings generated by the following AWS services:
+ [Amazon GuardDuty](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/what-is-guardduty.html)
+ [Amazon Inspector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_introduction.html)
+ [Amazon Macie](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/userguide/what-is-macie.html)

To integrate these services with Security Hub, you just need to enable them in your account on the console for each service\. A resource policy that allows Security Hub to get findings from these services is automatically created and applied\. You do not need to configure any settings to start getting findings from them\. After you enable them, Security Hub immediately starts collecting findings in that account from these services\. If you don't have a supported AWS product enabled, or the integration is not enabled in Security Hub, no findings are sent to Security Hub\. You can verify whether a product integration is enabled on the **Integrations** page of the Security Hub console\.

With GuardDuty, Security Hub imports GuardDuty findings of all of the supported finding types\. New findings from GuardDuty are sent to Security Hub within 5 minutes\. Updates to findings are sent based on the **Updated findings** setting for CloudWatch Events in GuardDuty settings\. For more information about GuardDuty findings, see [Amazon GuardDuty Findings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_findings.html)\.

With Amazon Inspector, Security Hub imports Amazon Inspector findings that are generated through assessment runs based on all supported rules packages\. For more information about Amazon Inspector rules packages and rules, see [Amazon Inspector Rules Packages and Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_rule-packages.html)\.

With Macie, a finding \(currently known as an alert\) can be one of the following indices: **CloudTrail data**, **S3 bucket properties**, and **S3 objects**\. For more information, see [Locating and Analyzing Macie Alerts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/userguide/macie-alerts.html#macie-alert-working-locate)\. Security Hub imports Macie basic and custom alerts \(findings\) only from the **S3 bucket properties** and **S3 objects** indices\. Macie does not send data classifications\. Security Hub does *not* import Macie findings from the **CloudTrail data** index\.
