# Security standards in AWS Security Hub<a name="securityhub-standards"></a>

AWS Security Hub consumes, aggregates, and analyzes security findings from various supported AWS and third\-party products\.

Security Hub also generates its own findings as the result of running automated and continuous checks against the rules in a set of supported security standards\. These checks provide a readiness score and identify specific accounts and resources that require attention\.

Security Hub provides controls for the following standards\.
+ [CIS AWS Foundations](securityhub-standards-cis.md)
+ [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard \(PCI DSS\)](securityhub-standards-pcidss.md)
+ [AWS Foundational Security Best Practices](securityhub-standards-fsbp.md)
