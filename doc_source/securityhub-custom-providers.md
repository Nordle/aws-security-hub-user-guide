# Custom Product Integrations<a name="securityhub-custom-providers"></a>

In addition to findings generated by the integrated AWS service and third\-party product, Security Hub can also consume findings that are generated by various custom security products you may use\. You can import these findings into Security Hub manually using the [BatchImportFindings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchImportFindings.html) API operation\.

Follow these instructions when invoking the `BatchImportFindings` API operation to import findings generated by custom security products: 
+ You must provide the finding details using the [AWS Security Finding format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-findings-format.html)\.
+ You must enable Security Hub before you can successfully invoke the `BatchImportFindings` API operation\.
+ When you enable Security Hub, a default product Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) for Security Hub is generated in your current account\. This product ARN has the following format: `arn:aws:securityhub:<region>:<account-id>:product/<account-id>/default`\. For example, `arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-2:123456789012:product/123456789012/default`\.

  Use this product ARN as the value for the [ProductArn](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_AwsSecurityFinding.html#securityhub-Type-AwsSecurityFinding-ProductArn) attribute when invoking the `BatchImportFindings` API operation\.
+ We recommend that you use the [ProductFields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_AwsSecurityFinding.html#securityhub-Type-AwsSecurityFinding-ProductFields) attribute to define the name of the product that generates the findings that you're importing\. For example, if you're integrating Cloud Custodian with Security Hub, you could use the following values\.

  ```
  "ProductFields": 
    {
      "ProviderName": "CloudCustodian",
      "ProviderVersion": "0.8.32.1",
    }
  ```
**Note**  
Cloud Custodian is a flexible rules engine that is commonly used as a solution for automated security, compliance, and cost management in the cloud\. For more information about integrating Cloud Custodian with Security Hub, see [Announcing Cloud Custodian Integration with AWS Security Hub](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/announcing-cloud-custodian-integration-aws-security-hub/) on the AWS Open Source Blog\.
+ You must supply, manage, and increment your own finding IDs, using the [Id](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_AwsSecurityFinding.html#securityhub-Type-AwsSecurityFinding-Id) attribute\. Each new finding must have a unique finding ID\.
+ You must specify your own account ID, using the [AwsAccountId](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_AwsSecurityFinding.html#securityhub-Type-AwsSecurityFinding-AwsAccountId) attribute\.
+ You must supply your own timestamps for the [CreatedAt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_AwsSecurityFinding.html#securityhub-Type-AwsSecurityFinding-CreatedAt) and [UpdatedAt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_AwsSecurityFinding.html#securityhub-Type-AwsSecurityFinding-UpdatedAt) attributes\.
+ In addition to importing new findings from custom products, you can also update existing findings from custom products using the `BatchImportFindings` API operation\. To update existing findings, use the existing finding ID \(via the [Id](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_AwsSecurityFinding.html#securityhub-Type-AwsSecurityFinding-Id) attribute\) while resending the full finding with the appropriate information updated in the request, including a modified [UpdatedAt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_AwsSecurityFinding.html#securityhub-Type-AwsSecurityFinding-UpdatedAt) timestamp\.
