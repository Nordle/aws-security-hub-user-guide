# Findings in AWS Security Hub<a name="securityhub-findings"></a>

AWS provides a highly secure cloud computing environment where you can run your workloads\. When you use AWS services, you can also access various security, identity, and compliance tools from AWS and its partners\. These tools include firewalls, endpoint, and intrusion detection applications, as well as database security, vulnerability, and compliance scanners\. These tools can generate thousands of security findings daily\. Findings from these tools might have different finding formats and might be stored and viewed across different platforms\.

In this context, it can be difficult to get a complete understanding of your overall security and compliance state\. To do so, you would have to either continuously and manually process the output from all of these tools or develop ways to aggregate and analyze the generated findings\. With large workloads and environments, processing and analyzing this data can take hundreds of hours of building parsers, transformers, custom compliance rules, and data enrichment pipelines\. Even then, the volume of the findings can sometimes be more than you can effectively process\. Therefore, it can be difficult to separate potential security issues from noise, to prioritize the findings that matter most to you, and to ensure that you arenâ€™t missing any critical findings\. AWS Security Hub eliminates this complexity and reduces the effort required to manage and improve the security and compliance of all of your AWS accounts, resources, and workloads\.

Security Hub imports findings from AWS security services and from the third\-party product integrations that you enable\. Security Hub consumes these findings using a standard findings format called AWS Security Finding Format, which eliminates the need for time\-consuming data conversion efforts\. Security Hub then correlates the findings across integrated products to prioritize the most important ones\. For more information about the findings format, see [AWS Security Finding Format](securityhub-findings-format.md)\.
