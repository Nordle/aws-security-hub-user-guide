# Product Integrations in AWS Security Hub<a name="securityhub-findings-providers"></a>

AWS Security Hub provides available integrations with several AWS services and third\-party products\.

You can also import findings that are generated from your own custom security products\.

**Important**  
Security Hub detects and consolidates only those security findings from the supported AWS and partner product integrations that are generated after Security Hub is enabled in your AWS accounts\.  
It does not retroactively detect and consolidate security findings that were generated before you enabled Security Hub\.
