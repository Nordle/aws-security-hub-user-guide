# Product Integrations in AWS Security Hub<a name="securityhub-findings-providers"></a>

This section lists the AWS services and third\-party products that you can integrate with AWS Security Hub and instructions for enabling them\. It also provides instructions for importing findings that are generated from your own custom security products\.

**Important**  
Security Hub detects and consolidates only those security findings from the supported AWS and partner product integrations that are generated after Security Hub is enabled in your AWS accounts\. It doesn't retroactively detect and consolidate security findings that were generated before you enabled Security Hub\.
