# Results of Security Standards Checks<a name="securityhub-standards-results"></a>

When it runs checks against the enabled controls for the enabled security standards, AWS Security Hub generates findings\. These findings use the AWS Security Finding Format \(ASFF\)\.

## Standards\-Related Information in the ASFF<a name="securityhub-standards-results-asff"></a>

For findings generated by security standards checks, the [`Compliance`](securityhub-findings-format.md#asff-compliance) field in the ASFF contains the standards\-related findings details\. The [`Compliance`](securityhub-findings-format.md#asff-compliance) field includes the following information\.
+ A `Status` field that contains result of the most recent check that Security Hub ran against a given control\. The results of the previous checks are kept in an archived state for 90 days\.
+ A `RelatedRequirements` array that contains a list of related requirements for the control

## Determining the Overall Status of a Control from Its Findings<a name="securityhub-standards-results-status"></a>

In the findings generated by security standards checks, the `Status` field is assigned one of the following values\.
+ `PASSED`
+ `FAILED`
+ `WARNING` – Indicates that the check was completed, but Security Hub cannot determine whether the resource is in a `PASSED` or `FAILED` state
+ `NOT_AVAILABLE` – Indicates that the check cannot be completed because there is a server failure, the resource was deleted, or the result of the AWS Config evaluation was `NOT_APPLICABLE`\. If the AWS Config evaluation result was `NOT_APPLICABLE`, then after 3 days, Security Hub automatically archives the finding\.

The overall status for each control is based on the `Status` values of the active findings for that control\. The available values for the overall status are as follows:
+ **Passed** – Indicates that all findings in the Security Hub master account and the member accounts for a given control are in a `PASSED` state\.
+ **Failed** – Indicates that one or more findings in the Security Hub master account and the member accounts for a given control are in a Failed state\. 
+ **Unknown** – Indicates that at least one finding in the Security Hub master account and the member accounts for a given control is in a `WARNING` or `NOT_AVAILABLE` state, but no findings are in a `FAILED` state\.

## Rules for Updating Standards\-Related Findings<a name="securityhub-standards-results-updating"></a>

If a subsequent check against a given rule generates a new result \(for example, the status of "Avoid the use of the root account" changes from `FAILED` to `PASSED`\), a new finding is generated that contains the most recent result\.

If a subsequent check against a given rule generates a result that is identical to the current result, the existing finding is updated, and no new finding is generated\.
