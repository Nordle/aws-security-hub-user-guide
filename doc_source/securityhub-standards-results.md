# Results of security checks<a name="securityhub-standards-results"></a>

When it runs checks against the enabled controls for the enabled security standards, AWS Security Hub generates findings\. These findings use the AWS Security Finding Format \(ASFF\)\.

## Standards\-related information in the ASFF<a name="securityhub-standards-results-asff"></a>

For findings generated by security checks, the [`Compliance`](securityhub-findings-format.md#asff-compliance) field in the ASFF contains the standards\-related findings details\. The [`Compliance`](securityhub-findings-format.md#asff-compliance) field includes the following information\.
+ A `Status` field that contains result of the most recent check that Security Hub ran against a given control\. The results of the previous checks are kept in an archived state for 90 days\.
+ A `RelatedRequirements` array that contains a list of related requirements for the control

## Determining the severity of security standards findings<a name="securityhub-standards-results-severity"></a>

For security standards findings, the severity \(`Severity.Label`\) is determined based on an assessment on how easy it would be to compromise AWS resources if the issue is detected\.
+ **`CRITICAL` –** The issue must be remediated immediately to avoid it escalating\.

  For example, an open S3 bucket is considered a critical severity finding\. Because so many actors scan for open S3, buckets, the data in an exposed S3 bucket is likely to be discovered and accessed by others\. In general, resources with overly\-broad access rights that allow unintended public access are considered critical\.

  These issues should have the highest SLAs in terms of response times\. 
+ **`HIGH` –** The issue must be addressed as a priority\.

  For example, CloudTrail logging not being enabled is considered a high severity issue, because malicious actors can disable logging to hide the actions taken within infrastructure in which they've established a presence\.

  We recommend that you treat this security issue as a priority and take immediate remediation steps\. 
+ **`MEDIUM` –** The issue must be addressed but not urgently\.

  For example, lack of encryption at\-rest is considered a medium severity finding, because the data is not active and is less vulnerable to exposure\.

  We recommend that you investigate the implicated resource at your earliest convenience\. 
+ **`LOW` –** The issue does not require action on its own\.

  For example, discovering EC2 instances without required tags is considered low severity because a lack of tags can lead to a lack of resource visibility, but a lack of tags does not usually directly lead to resources being compromised\.

  There is no immediate action needed on low severity issues, but they can provide context when correlated with other issues\.
+ **`INFORMATIONAL` –** No issue was found\. In other words, the status is `PASSED`\. There is no recommended action\. Informational findings help customers to demonstrate that they are in a compliant state\.

## Determining the overall status of a control from its findings<a name="securityhub-standards-results-status"></a>

In the findings generated by security checks, the `Status` field is assigned one of the following values\.
+ `PASSED`
+ `FAILED`
+ `WARNING` – Indicates that the check was completed, but Security Hub cannot determine whether the resource is in a `PASSED` or `FAILED` state
+ `NOT_AVAILABLE` – Indicates that the check cannot be completed because there is a server failure, the resource was deleted, or the result of the AWS Config evaluation was `NOT_APPLICABLE`\.

  If the AWS Config evaluation result was `NOT_APPLICABLE`, then Security Hub automatically archives the finding\.

The overall status for each control is based on the `Compliance.Status` and `Workflow.Status` values of the active findings for that control\. It uses the active findings in the master account and the member accounts\. The available values for the overall status are as follows:
+ **Passed** – Indicates that one of the following is true\.
  + All findings have a `Compliance.Status` of `PASSED`\.
  + All findings have a `Workflow.Status` of `RESOLVED`\. If all findings are `RESOLVED`, then the control status is **Passed**, regardless of `Compliance.Status`\.
  + All findings either have a `Compliance.Status` of `PASSED`, or have a `Compliance.Status` of `FAILED` but a `Workflow.Status` of `SUPPRESSED`\.
+ **Failed** – Indicates that the following is true\.
  + At least one finding has a `Compliance.Status` of `FAILED`\.
  + None of those `FAILED` findings has a `Workflow.Status` of `SUPPRESSED` or `RESOLVED`\.
+ **Unknown** – Indicates that the following is true\.
  + At least one finding has a `Compliance.Status` of `WARNING` or `NOT_AVAILABLE`\.
  + None of those `WARNING` or `NOT_AVAILABLE` findings has a` Workflow.Status `of `SUPPRESSED` or `RESOLVED`\.
  + No findings have a `Compliance.Status` of `FAILED`\.

## Determining the security score for a security standard<a name="securityhub-standards-security-score"></a>

On the **Security standards** page, each enabled standard displays a security score, which is between 0% and 100%\.

The security score represents the proportion of **Passed** controls to enabled controls\. The score is displayed as a percentage\. For example, if 10 controls are enabled for a standard, and 7 of those controls are in a **Passed** state, then the security score is 70%\.

On the **Summary** page, the **Security standards** card also displays the security scores for each enabled standard\. It also displays a consolidated security score that represents the proportion of passed controls to enabled controls across all of the enabled standards\.

## Rules for updating standards\-related findings<a name="securityhub-standards-results-updating"></a>

If a subsequent check against a given rule generates a new result \(for example, the status of "Avoid the use of the root account" changes from `FAILED` to `PASSED`\), a new finding is generated that contains the most recent result\.

If a subsequent check against a given rule generates a result that is identical to the current result, the existing finding is updated, and no new finding is generated\.

Security Hub automatically archives findings from controls if the associated resource was deleted, based on one of the following criteria\.
+ The finding was not updated in three days\.
+ The associated AWS Config evaluation returned `NOT_APPLICABLE`\.
